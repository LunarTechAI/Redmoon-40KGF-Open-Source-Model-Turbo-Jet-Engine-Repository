# Redmoon 40KGF: One-Page Valuation Summary

**For:** Founders & Leadership  
**Date:** December 30, 2025

---

## The Bottom Line

**Your engine technology is worth between $2.5 billion and $4 billion today.**

This makes Redmoon a **Unicorn** — a private company valued at over $1 billion.

---

## Why Is It Worth This Much?

### 1. You Built an Exclusive Club

There are only **5-7 companies in the world** that can build a turbojet engine in the 40kg thrust class. You're now one of them. When you're one of seven suppliers for an entire global industry, you have serious pricing power.

### 2. Competitors Would Need 7-10 Years to Catch Up

Even if a well-funded competitor started today, it would take them nearly a decade to replicate what you've built. That time gap is your moat.

### 3. Western Governments Need You

Your technology is **NDAA-compliant**, meaning Western militaries can actually buy from you. Many existing suppliers have supply chains that touch restricted countries. You don't.

### 4. Your Competition Just Collapsed

**JetCat Americas** (your main competitor's US distributor) collapsed in Q4 2024 — they sued their parent company and there's **no US dealer or service center** anymore. That's your opening.

### 5. The Market Is Exploding

The drone market is growing at **15-50% annually** depending on segment. Military UAVs, cargo delivery, agriculture — all need propulsion.
