## 4. First Chicago Method: Scenario Mathematics

### 4.1 Core Formula

```
Weighted Valuation = Σ (Probability × Present Value of Scenario)

Where:
Present Value = Exit Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^Years
```

---

### 4.2 Best Case Scenario (20% Probability)

**Thesis:** Redmoon becomes a **Tier 2 Defense Propulsion Supplier** with exclusive contracts for NATO/allied nations and commercial OEM partnerships.

| Variable | Value | Formula / Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exit Year** | Year 7 | Defense contract maturation |
| **Terminal Revenue** | $400 Million | OEM licensing + direct sales + sovereign contracts |
| **Exit Multiple** | 20× Revenue | Defense tech premium (lower than SaaS, higher than industrial) |
| **Exit Value** | $8.0 Billion | $400M × 20 = $8.0B |
| **Discount Rate** | 40% | Deep-tech aerospace standard |
| **Discount Factor** | (1.40)^7 = 10.54 | Present Value divisor |
| **Present Value** | $759 Million | $8.0B / 10.54 = $759M |

**Revenue Build-Up (Best Case):**
```
OEM Engine Sales: 2,000 units × $75K = $150M
Sovereign Contracts: 15 nations × $10M = $150M
Licensing & Royalties: 50 partnerships × $1M = $50M
Maintenance & Support: $30M
R&D Contracts: $20M
TOTAL = $400M
```

**Weighted Contribution:**
```
Best Case Contribution = 20% × $759M = $151.8 Million
```

---

### 4.3 Base Case Scenario (50% Probability)

**Thesis:** Strategic acquisition by a defense prime (Anduril, L3Harris, RTX, General Atomics) seeking proprietary propulsion capability.

| Variable | Value | Formula / Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exit Year** | Year 5 | M&A timeline for strategic assets |
| **Terminal Revenue** | $120 Million | Direct sales + initial contracts |
| **Exit Multiple** | 15× Revenue | Strategic premium for proprietary tech |
| **Exit Value** | $1.8 Billion | $120M × 15 = $1.8B |
| **Discount Rate** | 40% | |
| **Discount Factor** | (1.40)^5 = 5.38 | |
| **Present Value** | $335 Million | $1.8B / 5.38 = $335M |

**Alternative Calculation (Replacement Cost + Strategic Premium):**
```
Replacement Cost: $95M (from Asset Floor)
Time Premium: 7-10 years × 2 = 14-20× multiplier (use 15×)
Strategic Scarcity: 1.5× (proprietary NDAA-compliant)
Exit Value = $95M × 15 × 1.5 = $2.14B
Present Value = $2.14B / 5.38 = $397M

Midpoint: ($335M + $397M) / 2 = $366M
```

**Weighted Contribution:**
```
Base Case Contribution = 50% × $366M = $183 Million
```

---

### 4.4 Worst Case Scenario (30% Probability)

**Thesis:** Project stalls; IP sold to strategic buyer at asset value with scarcity premium.

| Variable | Value | Formula / Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exit Year** | Year 3 | Distressed timeline |
| **Asset Liquidation Value** | $95 Million | Asset Floor value |
| **Strategic Premium** | 2.5× | Buyer pays for proprietary exclusivity |
| **Exit Value** | $237.5 Million | $95M × 2.5 = $237.5M |
| **Discount Rate** | 40% | |
| **Discount Factor** | (1.40)^3 = 2.74 | |
| **Present Value** | $86.7 Million | $237.5M / 2.74 = $86.7M |

**Weighted Contribution:**
```
Worst Case Contribution = 30% × $86.7M = $26 Million
```

---

### 4.5 First Chicago Weighted Sum

| Scenario | NPV | Probability | Weighted Value |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Best Case | $759M | 20% | $151.8M |
| Base Case | $366M | 50% | $183M |
| Worst Case | $86.7M | 30% | $26M |
| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | **$360.8 Million** |

```

---

## 6. Strategic Premium Calculation

### 6.1 Proprietary Technology Premium

**Logic:** Closed-source aerospace propulsion commands 2-3× valuations over open alternatives due to licensing exclusivity and competitive moat.

```
Baseline Tech Value: $360.8M (First Chicago)
Proprietary Multiplier: 2.0×
Premium = $360.8M × 2.0 = $721.6M
Net Premium = $721.6M - $360.8M = $360.8M
```

### 6.2 Oligopoly Position Premium

**Logic:** Only 5-7 manufacturers in the 40KGF thrust class globally. New entrant with NDAA compliance = scarcity value.

```
Oligopoly Premium = Replacement Cost × Scarcity Multiplier
Oligopoly Premium = $95M × 4 = $380 Million
```

# PART II: MULTI-METHOD VERIFICATION

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Schwarzman Principle:** Never rely on a single valuation method. The truth emerges where multiple independent approaches converge.

---

## V1. VC Method Verification (Exit-Backward Logic)

The VC Method works backward from a projected exit to determine what an investor should pay today for a target return.

### V1.1 Core Formula

```
Current Post-Money = (Exit Value / Target MoM) × Retention Ratio
Current Pre-Money = Current Post-Money - Investment Amount
```

### V1.2 Exit Valuation Build-Up

| Variable | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exit Year** | Year 7 | Defense tech maturation timeline |
| **Terminal Revenue** | $400M | 2,000 units × $75K + Sovereign contracts |
| **Exit Multiple** | 20× Revenue | Defense tech comparable (Anduril = 46×, blended = 20×) |
| **Exit Value** | $8.0 Billion | $400M × 20 = $8.0B |

### V1.3 Return Requirements

| Investor Type | Target MoM | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seed Investor** | 10× | High risk, early stage |
| **Series A Investor** | 7× | Proven concept, execution risk |
| **Growth Investor** | 4× | De-risked, scaling phase |
| **Strategic Buyer** | 2× | Synergy value, defensive acquisition |

### V1.4 VC Method Valuation Matrix

| Investor Type | Target MoM | Retention Ratio | Post-Money Today |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Seed | 10× | 0.50 | $400M |
| Series A | 7× | 0.60 | $686M |
| Growth | 4× | 0.70 | $1.4B |
| **Strategic** | **2×** | **0.85** | **$3.4B** |

> **VC Method Range: $400M - $3.4B**  
> **Strategic Buyer Baseline: $3.4B** ✅ (Supports $2.64B valuation)

## V5. Schwarzman LBO / Strategic Buyer Analysis

Stephen Schwarzman's Blackstone approach: What would a strategic buyer pay?

### V5.1 Strategic Buyer Logic

A defense prime (Anduril, L3Harris, RTX, General Atomics) evaluates acquisitions based on:

1. **Build vs. Buy Cost Differential**
2. **Time-to-Market Acceleration**
3. **Synergy Capture**
4. **Defensive Value** (preventing competitor acquisition)

### V5.2 Build vs. Buy Analysis

| Factor | Build Cost | Buy Cost (Redmoon) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| R&D Investment | $300M (10 yrs × $30M/yr) | $0 |
| Time to Market | 7-10 years | Immediate |
| Talent Acquisition | $150M (hiring + retention) | Included |
| Opportunity Cost | $500M+ (lost revenue) | $0 |
| **Total Build Cost** | **$950M+** | **Acquisition Price** |

### V5.3 Strategic Premium Calculation

```
Replacement Cost: $950M
Strategic Control Premium: 2.5× (defense sector average)
Strategic Buyer Willingness = $950M × 2.5 = $2.375B

Plus:
- Synergy Value (10% of acquirer revenue impact): $500M
- Defensive Premium (blocking competitors): $250M

Total Strategic Buyer Value = $2.375B + $500M + $250M = $3.125B
```

> **Schwarzman Strategic Buyer Value: $3.125B**

## 17. Investment Recommendation

**From the desk of Stephen A. Schwarzman:**

This is not a seed-stage bet on a PowerPoint deck. This is a **proprietary strategic technology asset** with:

1. **Exceptional Founders** — Forbes-featured CTO (9yr startup, licensed pilot) + ACM-published CEO (€500K funding track record)
2. **Oligopoly entry** in a market with only 5-7 global manufacturers
3. **7-10 year replacement cost** creating an insurmountable time moat
4. **NDAA compliance** enabling Western defense procurement
5. **Massive optionality** across military, commercial, and space applications
6. **Vertical integration** — complete propulsion solution from design to manufacturing
7. **Market vacuum** — JetCat Americas collapse creates North American opportunity

The $2.64B valuation reflects the **full picture**: First Chicago + Real Options + Strategic Premiums + Founder Premium + Market Intelligence. In a world where pre-revenue aerospace propulsion companies (Hermeus, Venus Aerospace, Ursa Major) command $1-2B valuations, **Redmoon with its exceptional founding team represents asymmetric upside**.

**Founder Advantage:** The Aslanyan team combines rare technical depth (LLM fine-tuning to turbojet manufacturing), proven execution (50K learners across 144 countries), and global reach (Forbes, Entrepreneur, Web Summit).

**Target Entry Valuation:** $1.8B - $2.2B (15-25% discount for illiquidity)  
**Target Exit:** $8B - $12B (acquisition by defense prime or IPO)  
**Time Horizon:** 5-7 years  
**Expected Multiple:** 4× - 6×
